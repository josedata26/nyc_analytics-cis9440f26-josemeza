-- Purpose: to clean and standardize nyc_restaurant_inspection_primary data
-- Grain: one row per violation cited during one DOHMH restaurant inspection, identified by camis + inspection_date + inspection_type + violation_code.
-- Scope: inspections dated 2020-01-01 through 2025-12-31 (filtered at extraction). Inspections with no violations are kept as one row with violation_code NULL.
